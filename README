Win32-TW

TRADOS Workbench is a front-end utility for working with translation memories.
It is strictly operated from the GUI, so for scripting we need to "remote
control" the GUI using L<Win32::GuiTest>, truly by far my favorite way of
controlling GUI-based software under Windows.

Essentially, Win32::TW defines a convenient API for manipulating Workbench
from Perl.  There are still significant limitations - Workbench will only
open one TM at a time, for example - but it actually turns out to be
pretty easy to automate it.  This takes care of it for you.
