Win32-TW

TRADOS Workbench is a front-end utility for working with translation memories.
It is strictly operated from the GUI, so for scripting we need to "remote
control" the GUI using L<Win32::GuiTest>, truly by far my favorite way of
controlling GUI-based software under Windows.

Essentially, Win32::TW defines a convenient API for manipulating Workbench
from Perl.  There are still significant limitations - Workbench will only
open one TM at a time, for example - but it actually turns out to be
pretty easy to automate it.  This takes care of it for you.

Caveat at the moment: it ain't done.  So it's not CPAN-ready yet.

Caveat overall: there is no unit testing.  TRADOS will only allow each
installation to work with a maximum of five languages, so I can't assume
any two languages to be available for unit testing.  This could probably
be solved by using the installer's "last" TM - but I'll have to figure
out a general way to start the last TM before I can use that for unit
testing, and I just can't be bothered at the moment.

Right now, I'm writing test scripts as I go.  It's a sucky way to work,
but it's quicker and easier to get off the ground with it for the time being.
